## Daily Video 1
**TARGET: what is the difference between an implicit and explicit thesis?**
- should be at end of intro + map for evidence
    - main idea (arguable)
    - evidence (why?)
- *explicit* provides clear claim and focus(es)
- *implicit* suggests a thesis but does not exclusively mention evidence


## Daily Video 2
**TARGET: how to write implicit/explicit thesis**
- *explicit* thesis
    - clearly define the reasons that you are proving in the essay
- *implicit* thesis
    - reasons will be presented later in the essay, not in the intro
- good to always write a clear claim
- make sure reasons will be supported effectively by evidence
