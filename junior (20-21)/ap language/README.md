# AP English Language and Composition
Almost all of my notes here will follow the CollegeBoard AP Daily videos for
the 2020-2021 school year. I've never taken notes for an English class before,
but a handwritten notes style didn't work for me so I chose to move to digital
notes. Starting from Unit 5, I will specify which part of the AP exam that the 
video is tailored towards.
