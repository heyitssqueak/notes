## AP US History (MHS)
These are my notes taken while I was reading my APUSH textbook, The American
Pagaent, 15th Edition. I wrote them in Notion at the time and planned to go
back and add comments, highlights, and summaries for each of the sections, but
ended up not following through. The only chapter that represents what I had 
planned to accomplish is Chapter 7, where I added vocabulary, recall, and an
overview. I also did not finish the textbook, so there are quite a few missing
chapters.

This class was taught by Ms. Alison Turner at Middleton High School and I 
received a 4 on the AP exam.
